<p>
Here are the feature-describing attributes explained:
</p>
<p>
1. "הϵѻteric" – a regular, normal new feature (first level),
</p>
<p>
2. "הϵѻteric<b>²</b>" – an advanced, not trivial feature existing
   also in other editors (level 2),
</p>
<p>
3. "הϵѻteric<b>³</b>" – a prominent, possibly unfound 
anywhere else feature (level 3).
</p>

<p>

Basically, the levels measure how innovative (not necessarily
sophisticated) a feature is. I'm having many ideas (eg. a
collection of ~50 tasks in <b><a
href="https://github.com/naggie/dstask"
target="_new">dstask</a></b> nice TODO utility), so I've thought
that I could label/organize them with the indices, so that users
might have a possibility to initially easily know just "how much"
could they expect from a highlighted feature, and I would be able
to better prioritize them (when programming).
