The customization request is:

- asking for a not-heavy change, e.g.: change of a default key
  binding or a color of a window, etc.,

- asking for a small feature request like e.g.: ability to run the
  <a href="http://localhost:4000/unwritten_planned/">Periodic
  Command</a> on demand with a shortcut, or for adding a Help button
  to some dialogs, or for a new function for the scripting engine,

- also asking for a serious feature, if I'll like the idea – which
  might happen more "easily" if I'll be under pressure of a
  supporter ;) Besides, I have a catalogue of ~50 ideas for new
  features and a request from a supporter might just work like 
  prioritizing of them,

- there is a limit for number of such requests – 1 per 2 months plus
  one "floating" (i.e.: to be used at any moment) per year, giving
  a total of 7 requests.

In general, supporter gets support, being both help in resolving
issues and also hearing for change requests.
