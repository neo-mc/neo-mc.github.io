The window is being shown after any jump in the code, ie. after:
- page up/page down,
- any jump to a symbol via a CTags feature, ie. eg. after `alt-\`
  jump to the next CTags symbol, or after `alt-|` jump to the
  previous one, etc.

Presentation of the feature (Asciinema video; you can resize it
via `ctrl-plus` and `ctrl-minus`):
