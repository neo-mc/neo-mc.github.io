# CTags Features

Complete list of tags-related features is:

- jumping to the previous and next tag in the current file,
- jumping to the symbol under the cursor,
- jumping to the currently highlighted symbol in a popup menu,
- searching and displaying of the matching tags, and allowing
  jumps to them,
- listing of all tags of given type in a popup list.

## Previous/Next tag

To jump to the next symbol press `Alt-\`, to the previous –
`Alt-|`. 

Notice the mnemotechnique – the previous jump is via Shift
key-containing shortcut while the next-jump is not. Shift is a key
that's *pointing up*, because it's above Alt, hence this shortcut
is for *previous* tag.

## Symbol Under the Cursor

To jump to the symbol under the cursor, press `Alt-*`.

## Current Popup Entry

To jump to the current symbol in a completion menu popup, press
`Alt-?`.

## Searching For Matching Tags

To search for tags matching the word that's left of cursor, press
`Esc` and then `Enter`. This feature is similar to tag completion
(Shift-Tab), however it searches for tags that include, not only
begin with the current word.

## Listing Tags Of Given Type

To list tags for current file, that are:

- functions – press `Alt-Shift-F`,
- variables – `Alt-Shift-V`,
- type declarations – `Alt-Shift-T`,
- other than the above – `Alt-Shift-O`,
- all types `Alt-Shift-A`.
